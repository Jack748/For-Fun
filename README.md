Just because.  
Some mini-projects.  
There's not really a usage or anything.  
Feel free to explore and be curious.  


Here is a brief description for each. They are here in chronological order, I guess.  

**imdb** --> I was keeping a list of movies that I wanted to watch and that I watched on my google notes but I wanted to have them on my IMDB account so instead of manually and tediously doing it by hand I created an automatic clicker with Selenium that adds all the movies from a txt list to the IMDB account.  

**word embeddings** --> I played around with embeddings. I find so fascinating that words have a meaning that LLMs can put into a space. Then I checked distances and similarities between countries, cities, colors, food, dog breeds and similar. That was fun.  

**sleep** --> I was trying to optimize my sleep quality so I decided to log everyday all the factors that I thought influenced the quality. It was meant to be only a spreedsheet but then I tried to do some data analisys.

**sudoku.py, life_expectancy.py, blackjack.py** --> The python version of what I did with Java years before

**data visualization** --> I don' remember that but apparently is shit. Visualizing data about countries with Pandas and Matplotlib.  

**fractal** --> Is a mini script with Turtle that kinda draws a fractal.  

**snake** --> Is the game snake.  

**web scraping** --> I wanted to buy some weights to workout at home but it was pandemic time so they were always sold out at decathlon. I then created a web scraper that periodically checked the availability of the product and sent an email when I could buy them.  

**java for fun:** -->  
    **Blackjekke** --> After watching the movie 21 I got hyped with Blackjack and wanted to calculate the probabilities of winning with different strategies and counting cards etc. Is chaotic.  
    **Rand** --> I don't remember that well but I guess I wanted to verify with data the central limit theorem.  
    **Sudoku** --> I created a sudoku solver with Java.
